#  Round will be the object that processes responses and records guesses. A Round is initialized with a Deck. The idea is that when we start a Round, the current card is the first in the deck (the first in the Deckâ€™s array of Cards). When we make a guess, the guess is recorded, and the next card in the deck becomes the current card.

# The take_turn method is the crux of this problem. The take_turn method takes a string representing the guess. It should create a new Turn object with the appropriate guess and Card. It should store this new Turn, as well as return it from the take_turn method. Also, when the take_turn method is called, the Round should move on to the next card in the deck.

    @deck = deck

  # Create new Turn object with guess and card. It should store this new Turn, as well as return it from the take_turn method.
    new_turn = Turn.new(guess, current_card)

  # Also, when the take_turn method is called, the Round should move on to the next card in the deck.
